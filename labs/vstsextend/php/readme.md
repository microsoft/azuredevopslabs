## Overview

**PHP** is a server-side scripting language and a powerful tool enough for making dynamic and interactive Web pages.

This lab shows how to deploy **PHP** application to **Azure App** service using **Azure DevOps**.

### Prerequisites for the lab

1. Refer [Getting Started](../setup/readme/) before you follow the lab exercises.

1. Use the [Azure DevOps Demo Generator](https://azuredevopsdemogenerator.azurewebsites.net/?TemplateId=77365&Name=PHP){:target="_blank"} to provision project on your Azure DevOps Organization. 

## Exercise 1: Configure Release Definition

You will use ARM template as **Infrastructure as a Code** in the release definition to provision a Web App, and a Web App Service Plan under the specified resource group.

1. Go to **Releases** under **Pipelines** tab, select release definition **PHP** and click on **Edit**

1. Go to **Tasks** and select **Dev** environment.

1. Select the **Azure Resource Group Deployment** task, choose the **Azure subscription**. There are 2 ways of choosing the Azure subscription.
   
    * If your subscription is not listed or if you want to use an existing service principal, click the `Manage` link. 

        1. Click on the `+New Service Connection` button and select the **Azure Resource Manager** option. Provide Connection name, select the Azure Subscription from the list and then click on the Ok button. The Azure credentials will be required to authorize the connection.

    * If the subscription is already listed, select the Azure subscription from the list and click `Authorize`.

1. Select the desired **Location** for deployment.

1. Select the **Azure App Service Deploy** task and pick **Azure subscription** from the dropdown list, then click on **Save**.

    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th width="60%"><b>Tasks</b></th>
        <th><b>Usage</b></th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="images/azure_resource.png"> <b>Azure Resource Group Deployment</b></td>
      <td>Uses the provided ARM template to create a resource group with App Service plan and App Service</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="images/webapp.png"> <b>Azure App Service Deploy</b></td>
      <td>deploys a PHP application to the created App service</td>
    </tr>
   </table>

## Exercise 2: Deploying the application

**PHP** is an interpreted language, so you don't have to compile the code. Instead you will create an archive file which will be deployed to the Azure App Service.

Let's make a code change to trigger a CI-CD pipeline to build and deploy the application.

1. Go to **Repos** tab and navigate to the below path to edit the file.

   >php/config.php

   ![code1](images/Repos1_5.png)

1. Go to line number **11**, modify **PHP** to **DevOps for PHP using Azure DevOps** and commit the code.

   ![code_editing](images/Repos2_2.png)

1. Go to **Builds** tab under **Pipelines** to view the associated CI build in progress, click on ellipsis to **View build results**.

   ![build](images/build1.png)

   Let's explore the build definition. The tasks used in the build definition are listed below.

   ![Build Definition](images/builddef.png)

   <table width="70%">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th width="60%"><b>Tasks</b></th>
        <th><b>Usage</b></th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="images/Archive.png"> <b>Archive files</b></td>
      <td>We will archive all the files in the folder to a zip file</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="images/copyfiles.png"> <b>Copy Files</b></td>
      <td>Copy the ARM template and the Zip file to the artifact folder</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="images/PublishArtifact.png"> <b>Publish Build Artifacts</b></td>
      <td>Publish the build artifacts so that it is available to the Release pipeline</td>
    </tr>
   </table>

1. Once the build is completed, it triggers the CD pipeline. You can notice the linked release is in progress by navigating to **Releases** under **Pipelines**. The release will provision the Azure Web app and deploy the zip file generated by the associated build. Click on **View release** and then click on **Logs** to view the release summary.

1. Alternatively, you can also login to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com){:target="_blank"} and navigate to the **Resource Group** that contains the Web App that was provisioned in the CD pipeline.

1. Select the **App Service** and from the **Overview** tab,  click **Browse** to see the application deployed.
