## Overview ##

In this lab, you will learn about the usage of Advanced security features like preventing security leaks, scanning for the vulnerabilities and dependency scanning in software development process.

### Prerequisites ###

<a name="Ex0Task1"></a>
### Task 1: Configuring the eShopOnWeb team project ###

1. Navigate to [https://azuredevopsdemogenerator.azurewebsites.net](https://azuredevopsdemogenerator.azurewebsites.net/). This utility site will automate the process of creating a new Azure DevOps project within your account that is prepopulated with content (work items, repos, etc.) required for the lab. For more information on the site, please see [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/demo-gen](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/demo-gen).

1. Sign in using the Microsoft account associated with your Azure DevOps subscription.

### Task 1: Working with teams and iterations ###


1. Select the **Teams** tab. There are already three teams in this project.

    ![](images/001.png)

1. Select **"App Development Team"** and navigate to Iterations and Area Paths

    ![](images/002.png)

1. Currently this team is working on three iterations and we can add additional **iteration** by navigating to the Iterations section and by clicking on **Select iteration(s)**.

    ![](images/003.png)

1. **Save and Close** to finish the iteration assignment to DBA team

1. We can check all the work that is assigned to the team by navigating to the **Backlogs** section under the Boards.

     ![](images/backlog.png)

1. By clicking on '+' icon we can check the child level of workitems. Click on this icon for three times, this should display the child workitems type upto task.

     ![](images/backlog1.png)

1. Navigate to the **Sprints** section under the Boards. Change the team to DBA Team using the drop-down

    ![](images/004.png)

1. Click on task that says to update the database password  in a specific file
    
    ![](images/005.png)

1. Assign the task to yourself by choosing your ID in the drop-down and read the description of the task
    
    ![](images/006.png)

1. Drag and drop the task to **Active** field, since we are starting the work.

### Task 2: Updating the source code in Azure Repos ###


1. As per the task description we have to create a new branch before updating the credentials. So, use the ellipsis (**...**) icon and click on **New branch**

    ![](images/new-brnch.png)

1.  Create a new branch with a name **dbactivity** based on main

    ![](images/new-brnch1.png)

1.  Now, navigate to **src | web | appsettings.json** and start editing the file by clicking on **Edit** option

     ![](images/010.png)

1. Update the password in both line number 7 and 8.

    ![](images/011.png)

1. Click on **Commit**. Provide a commit message and choose the assigned work item by using the drop-down and **Commit**

    ![](images/012.png)

1. Use the Create a pull request option to create the pull request from **dbactivity** branch to the **main**

### Task 3: Navigation's in **Advanced Security** section ###

1. Once you click on **Advanced Security** you will observe alerts regarding the open-source package vulnerabilities present in your code- through both direct and transitive dependencies â€“ and provides straightforward guidance from the GitHub Advisory Database on how to upgrade your packages to mitigate the vulnerabilities. 

    ![](images/dependencies.png)

1. Click on **Code scanning** to check alerts on code security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and authorization bypass. This uses industry leading CodeQL static analysis engine

    ![](images/codescanning.png)

1. Click on **Secrets** where you can find alerts related to the secrets that have already been exposed in Azure Repos

    ![](images/secret.png)

1. Clicking on any of the alert will provide detailed description and recommendation to fix that particular case.

### Task 4: Creating the build and deployment ###
1. Select **Pipelines \| Pipelines** from the left navigation bar.

1. To trigger a build, choose the **eShoponweb-ASP.NET Core-CI** definition and then **Run Pipeline** to manually queue it.

    ![](images/createbuild.png)

   {% include note.html content= "We also have a YAML build pipeline if that's something you're interested in. To proceed through the YAML pipeline, choose **eShopOnWeb-Yaml** and click **Edit**." %}

1. Go to **Releases** under **Pipelines** and then select and **Edit** the **eShoponwebapp-Deployment** definition.

1. Click on **3 jobs, 4 tasks** option present just below the stage name **AzureAppService** to start configuring the stage

1. Under **Creating the Infra**, notice the task definition for **ARM Template deployment** task settings need attention. Click on that task.

1. You need to authorize the pipeline to deploy to Azure. Azure pipelines can automatically create a service connection with a new service principal, but we want to use the one we created earlier. Click **Manage**, this will redirect to the Service connections page. 
    
    ![](images/clickmanage.png)

   Click on **New Service connection** -> **Azure Resource Manager** -> **Service Principal (manual)**.
   Fill the information from previously created service principal:

    -  Subscription Id and name: can be found in the keyvault resource overview page.
    -  Service Principal Id = AppId in the copied notes.
    -  Service Principal key = Password in the copied notes.
    -  TenantId , copy from the notes.

    Click on **Verify** to check it works, give the connection a name and click **Verify and Save**.

    ![](images/SC-create.png)
   

1. Route back to the pipeline definition and choose the created service connection in the Azure subscription drop-down.

    ![](images/choose-sc.png)
 
1. Provide the location value as **Southeast Asia** where we deploy an ARM template.

    ![](images/armtemplatedeploytask.png)

   Notice the **Override template parameters** field has the database user name as a string but the password value is passed as a variable.

   `-WebsiteName $(WebsiteName) -eshop_ServerName $(eshop_ServerName)`

    
   You may want to complete the pipeline definition by specifying the subscription and location for the task. Repeat the same for the other task in the pipeline **Azure App Service Deploy** and **Azure SQL SqlTask**. Finally, save and create a new release to start the deployment.
