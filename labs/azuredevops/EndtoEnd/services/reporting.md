1. From the dashboard dropdown, select **eShopOnWeb Team Overview**. Dashboards allow teams to visualize the status and monitor progress across the project. At a glance, you can make informed decisions without having to drill down into other parts of your team project site. The Overview page provides access to a default team dashboard which you can customize by adding, removing, or rearranging the tiles. Each tile corresponds to a widget that provides access to one or more features or functions.
